Various sorting algorithms visualised in SFML

Currently bubble, insertion and selection sort have been implemented. Theres a few visualisation errors which will need to be redone. However, the sorting itself is sound as shown.
Wanting to finish off the selection of sorting algorithms before handling the visualisation aspect. The latter is an easy fix, however, I might implement a better method than I am doing currently, so need to think about it more.
